### sl.py
#
# This program takes any SL sentence S and displays either:
#
#   (1) a valuation that makes S false, or
#
#   (2) a derivation of S, which demonstrates that it's a
#       logical truth, i.e., true on all valuations.
#
# SL (= sentential logic) is formally decidable, so this 
# program should give an appropriate answer for any valid 
# input value. (Assuming no bugs!)
